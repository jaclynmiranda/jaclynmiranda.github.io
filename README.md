Jackie's Site!

### General Notes
  - This site uses magic to take your files and generate a website.
    - The website won't be exactly like your files.
  - Don't worry if you make mistakes.
    - git(hub) uses magic to let you undo them!

### Organization
  - You can ignore most of the files. Sorry about the mess.
  - These are the important ones:
    - **index.md** : the main page!
    - **pages** : files for basic pages
    - **_posts** : files for blog posts
    - **assets/images** : put your images here
    - **Tools** : scripts I wrote to help you. see below.
  - I'll handle the rest for now.
